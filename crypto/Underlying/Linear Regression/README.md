# Linear Regression (Bitcoin example)

y = β0 + β1x1 + β2x2 + ... + βnxn

where:

y = predicted Bitcoin price

β0 = intercept

β1, β2, ..., βn = coefficients for each input variable

x1, x2, ..., xn = input variables (such as historical prices, trading volumes, etc.)

To build the model, first collect historical data on Bitcoin prices and other relevant variables. Then split the data into a training set and a test set.

Next, use the training set to fit the linear regression model by estimating the values of the coefficients (β0, β1, β2, ..., βn) that best fit the data. This can be done using a variety of methods, such as ordinary least squares (OLS) regression.

Once the model is fitted, can use it to predict future Bitcoin prices by plugging in values for the input variables (x1, x2, ..., xn). For example, if there is data on the previous day's Bitcoin price, trading volume, and other variables, can use the model to predict the price for the next day.

It's important to note that linear regression models may not be the most accurate way to predict Bitcoin prices, as they rely on the assumption of a linear relationship between the input variables and the output variable. Other models, such as time series models or machine learning models, may be better suited for predicting cryptocurrency prices, explored in other directories.
